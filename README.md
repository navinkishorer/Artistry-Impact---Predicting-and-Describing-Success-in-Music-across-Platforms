# 🎵 Artistry Impact: Predicting and Describing Success in Music Across Platforms

## 📌 Overview

This project explores the factors that influence the popularity of songs using data from Spotify and YouTube. Using a blend of clustering, logistic regression, and neural networks, we attempt to predict which features make a song successful and assess if older tracks could trend today.

## 🎯 Objective

To identify which audio and metadata attributes most strongly predict a song’s popularity and to evaluate whether past hits could still gain traction in the current digital music landscape.

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Removed ~400 rows with missing values.
- Encoded special characters to ensure compatibility.
- Dropped non-essential columns (e.g., URLs, indexes, descriptions).
- Segregated a few hand-picked "old songs" for retrospective popularity analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation heatmaps
- Distribution visualizations
- Cluster profiling

### 3. Clustering (KMeans)
- Grouped songs into 6 clusters based on views, likes, and acoustic features.
- Consolidated them into 3 popularity tiers: **low**, **medium**, and **high**.

### 4. Predictive Modeling
- **Logistic Regression**: Provided interpretability and quick inference.
- **Neural Network**: 2 hidden layers (64 and 32 nodes), 1000 iterations, adaptive learning.

### 5. Evaluation
- Compared performance of models based on accuracy and classification metrics.
- Assessed model generalizability using test sets and old songs.

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Best Predictors**: `danceability` and `loudness` had the strongest association with popularity.
- **Model Choice**: Neural Networks outperformed logistic regression in identifying popular songs, especially on edge cases.
- **Old Song Revival**: Tracks like *Smooth Criminal*, *Dear Mama*, and *Iron Man* were predicted to still be popular in today's climate.

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Spotify:
- Consider remastering and promoting older tracks that fit today's successful feature profile.
- Use popularity predictors like `danceability` for seasonal song promotions (e.g., weddings, festivals).

### For Music Producers:
- Focus on optimizing key features (danceability, loudness, valence) that align with popular trends.
- Balance production values with experimental or unique sound elements to stand out.
